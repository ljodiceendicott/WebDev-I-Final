            CB on the beat
Perc', b****
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted
She do cocaine in my basement
I'm her doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix
Damn, why is she so demonic?
She Medusa with a little Pocahontas
She been lacin' all my drugs or somethin'
'Cause every time that we're together, I'm unconcious
Hold up, let me be honest
I know I saw her put the Percs in my chronic
Smokin' 'til my eyes roll back like the old man
Just another funeral for her, goddamn
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted
She do cocaine in my basement
I'm her doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix
Rockstar, that's our style, these boys can't take it (yeah)
Hatin', but they're still tryna take our cadence (woah)
No basic, brand new 'Rari when I'm racin'
Take it, let you roll my weed, please don't lace it, yeah
That's a bum b**** that you chasin', ayy
Foreign with me, she a dominatrix (woah)
I love that girl and I do like her body
I don't want the money, I just want the molly
That's what she say when she lookin' to find me
Lil' boy I'm your father, hakuna matata
I lick that girl, get up all of that, top her
Got drugs in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose my gold chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted
She do cocaine in my basement (in my basement)
I'm her doctor, but I'm runnin' out of patience (out of patience)
She told me that she tryna get closer to Satan (Satan)
She be talkin' to him when she in the matrix
My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends
I'm an open door, I ain't have to let her in
She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted (yeah)
Wasted, GTA love, b****es wasted
Wasted, I'm on these drugs, I feel wasted
Wasted, get her off my mind when I'm wasted
Wasted, I waste all my time when I'm wasted
Wasted
Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted
