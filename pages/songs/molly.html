            Mic check, one, two, aye, aye
Mic check, one, two, aye, aye, aye
Me and shawty on the highway going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place
Do whatever I say
Aye, got a little shawty (Got a little shawty)
She off of molly
She in love with the drugs
Wanna f*** when I'm done, kick her out no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got Lil Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, little n****, you look dumb
Aye, yeah
I been in any b**** in my space
Why'd he got that s***? He got his s*** way back in cross-state
When I f*** a shawty, she can never stay in my place
I can't ever f*** 'cause I don't know when I'm alone, like
Aight, she be on the cover, I can't let it show
Shawty let her Travis s***, she cook and sell the dough
If you ever got issues, you can let me know
He said he got it coming through, I need 'bout three of those
I need 'bout three of those; I need 'bout three or more
Don't really need a b****, ain't no problem to let her go
But if you f*** somebody else, you gotta let me know
I really want you to myself but got to let you go
Me and shawty on the highway going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place
Do whatever I say
Aye, got a little shawty (Got a little shawty)
She off of molly
She in love with the drugs
Wanna f*** when I'm done, kick her out no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got Lil Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, little n****, you look dumb
Aye, yeah
I been in any b**** in my space
Why'd he got that s***? He got his s*** way back in cross-state
When I f*** a shawty, she can never stay in my place
I can't ever f*** 'cause I don't know when I'm alone, like
No, won't lose
Tryna play the part but I won't let you though
Not heroic, I can't save these hoes, but damn she flexible
So I bend her like a pretzel
Bend it over, touch your toes
Say my name real loud so your neighbors know I'm home (Let's go!)
That little b**** insane
Coming 'round tryna pick my brain
But I can't let her though
She thinks she a clever hoe
Now her boyfriend know
She turned to a lonely hoe
All her friends know
Hit my line, we're next door
Me and shawty on the highway going back to my place
Beamer in the driveway, park it in the driveway
Cuban like my chain, going to a high stage
She gon' come to my place
Do whatever I say
Aye, got a little shawty (Got a little shawty)
She off of molly
She in love with the drugs
Wanna f*** when I'm done, kick her out no time for fun
If you talking, show me what's up, got Lil Tecca with the drum
Now you quiet, how it's 'sposed to be, little n****, you look dumb
Aye, yeah
I been in any b**** in my space
Why'd he got that s***? He got his s*** way back in cross-state
When I f*** a shawty, she can never stay in my place
I can't ever f*** 'cause I don't know when I'm alone, like, aye
