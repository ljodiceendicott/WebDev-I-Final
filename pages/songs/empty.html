            From the unknown
            I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
            Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
            Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
            Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
            I problem solve with Styrofoam
            My world revolves around a black hole
            The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
            Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
            I may go rogue
            Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
            Tote semi-autos
            Yeah, I'm keepin' it real, real, um
            Keepin' it real, uh yeah
            Life gets tough, shit is getting real
            I don't know how to feel
            Swallowing all these pills
            Know my real feels
            Devil standing here
            Tryna' make a deal, uh
            It ain't no deals
            Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
            Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
            I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still
            Bein' me, I rock PnB
            These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
            These drugs acting like
            Moshpits squishing me
            Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
            Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
            OD, feel like overdosing
            Low key I been looking for the signs
            But all I can find is a sign of the times
            From the unknown
            I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
            Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
            Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
            Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
            I problem solve with Styrofoam
            My world revolves around a black hole
            The same black hole that's in place of my soul, oh
            Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
            I may go rogue
            Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
            Tote semi-autos
            I ain't suicidal
            Only thing suicide is suicide doors
            Fight for survival
            Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up
            Hold my hand, through hell we go
            Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
            Gon' get to the racks, all them niggas want war
            Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
            Exhale depression as the wind blows
            These are the laws of living in vogue
            We're perfectly imperfect children
            Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission
            Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
            Now we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
            I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
            Now I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'
            From the unknown
            I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
            Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
            Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
            Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
            I problem solve with Styrofoam
            My world revolves around a black hole
            The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh

            I may go rogue
