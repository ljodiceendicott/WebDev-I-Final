            In my head, she said it's all in my head (my head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (you did)
She said I drove her away with my emotions (I drove her away)
Can't take the pain anymore, I'm feeling hopeless (can't take the pain)
In my head, she said it's all in my head (my head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (you did)
I don't even know why I try (I try)
You did me wrong and I can't forget that
Tell me what you want I know it's a lie (lie)
You broke my heart and you cannot fix that
You can't erase what you've done to me
But certainly, all you do is burden me
It's hurting deep
Our past is like a blur to me
It's hard to see, but look what you have done to me
What you want?
What you want from me?
What you want?
What you want from me?
What you want?
What you want from me?
In my head, she said it's all in my head (my head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (you did)
She said I drove her away with my emotions (I drove her away)
Can't take the pain anymore, I'm feeling hopeless (can't take the pain)
In my head, she said it's all in my head (my head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (you did)
In my head, she said it's all in my head (my head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (you did)
